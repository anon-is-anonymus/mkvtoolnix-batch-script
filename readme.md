### My batch script for mkvtoolnix

Just a batch script to mass add subtitles/change video formats in a given folder. Made for tv shows. Renames finalised videos to a format Jellyfin/Plex will be happy with

Requires the following vars when prompted
mkvmerge.exe path
Media Folder path
mkvtoolnix commands
Season Number

Why batch? I hate myself
